## Local development

Install deps and open root directory on any HTTP server.

```npm i```

```http-server .``` 

Note 1: Using bundler in development is discouraged.

Note 2: Always use .js extensions inside imports.

## Before production

```run run prod```

It will run formatting, app logic tests and create optimized bundle.

Currently there's no UI tests so manual verification is needed.
